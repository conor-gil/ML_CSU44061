# Run rfa.py
# Need training and test data in same folder as rfa.py
# It will output predictions into a new file
#
# At the moment it takes out data with n/a in it and as a result the predictions were not
# able to be submitted properly as I did not have a prediction for each test case as they do not map
# in properly. As a result the score I got when I submitted does not accurately reflect the performance
# of the actual model.
#
# There are a couple of other models commented out at the bottom of the file
